    <h1>How to create a personal page with GitHub</h1>
    <p>This is a step-by-step tutorial of how to set up a personal web page. We will start off with a very basic structure, but will include features that you can add to later down the track.
        You will need the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <ls>Computer</ls>
            <ls>   Internet Access</ls>
            <ls>  Internet Browser (i.e. google chrome)</ls>
            <ls>   Code editing software.      (We will be using “Visual Studio Code”)</ls>
            <ls>  A GitHub account</ls>
        </ol>
   <p>The tutorial will be broken into three parts. Creating the folders and files with structure necessary for web development; Writing html code using Visual Studio Code; and uploading your files upload to a server, in this case “GitHub”.</p>
<h2>First, we will look at setting up the files needed for a website. </h2>>
   <p>  (Note: For an in-depth look at what makes up a website, follow the link to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files">MDN:Dealing with files</a>)</p>
<p>Start by creating a directory somewhere easy to find, (i.e. desktop), and name it something like “web-projects”. (Note: a “directory” is the coding term for folder on a computer). </p>
<img src="d1.png" alt="Folder on a desktop named 'web-projects'" />
<p>We will use this directory to store everything that will be on your website. Make three directories within the new directory: images; styles; script. (Note: avoid spaces in file names. A good practice is to use “–“ instead of a space, i.e. “my dog”=”my-dog”).</p>
<img src="d2.png" alt="three folders inside the 'web-projects' folder named: images; script; styles" />
<p>Place any images that you want on your webpage (i.e. profile picture) in the folder named…….you guessed it, images.</p>

<h3>It’s time to start coding. </h3>
<p>For this you will need to open VSC.    (<a href=https://code.visualstudio.com/>Visual Studio Code: download</a>)</p>
<p>If you don’t already have VSC, click the link above and follow the instructions to download and install the software.</p>
<p>Open VSC and click </p> 
<ol> 
    <p><ls>New file</ls></p>
    <p><ls>Text file 'Built-in</ls></p>
    <p><ls>fill with template</ls></p>
    <p><ls>html doc</ls></p>
</ol>
<p>You should have a screen that looks something like this.</p>
<img src="v5.png" alt="VSC's html code template " />
<p>Proceed to fill in your title name (this will be what is displayed on your Tab bar). Once this is completed enter the following text in the space below "<body></body>"</p>
<img src="vs-text.png" alt="VSC code for heading and image insertion"/>
<p>Your code should look something like this. (Note: make sure all the spelling/punctuation of the file names are exact and correspond with the files/directories created earlier). Your finished page should look something like this.</p>

<p>Now its time to save our work and officially create our html file.</p>
<p>Click save as and navigate to the directory you made earlier. Save the file name is “index.html”.</p>
<img src="v7.png" alt="save file 'index.html'"/>
<p>Once this is done, we can test our code by clicking on the “Run and Debug icon on the left of your VSC window.</p>

<h4>Now that our files are complete, we are ready to upload to an online server. </h4>
<p>Open <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and follow the instructions to create your online profile.</p>
<p>Now that you have a profile you will need to create a repository. (This is what you will type into the browser)</p>
<img src="img4.png" alt="hithub home screen with dropdown list"/>
<ol>
    <p><ls>1.	Click on the round icon on the top right of your window containing your avatar (this will be patterns if you are just logging in for the first time). </ls><p/>
<p><ls>2.	This will open a dropdown list, click “Your repositories”.</ls></p>
<p><ls>3.	Click on the green “New” button.</ls></p>

<img src="img5.png" alt="github repositories screen"/>
<p><ls>4.	4.	Enter a repository name, then “Create Repository”.</ls></p>   
<img src="img6.png" alt="github create repository screen"/>
<p><ls>5.	Click on “upload an existing file.”</ls></p>
<p><ls>Open up your file browser, then drag and drop the “web-projects” directory that you made earlier, into the box.</ls></p>
<p><ls></ls>
</ol>
<p>You can now test your personal webpage by typing your repository from earlier into the browser.</p>
