    <h1>How to create a personal page with GitHub</h1>
    <p>This is a step-by-step tutorial of how to set up a personal web page.
        You will need the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <p>  <ls>Computer</ls></p>
          <p><ls>   Internet Access</ls></p>
          <p><ls>  Internet Browser (i.e. google chrome)</ls></p>
            </ol>
  
            <h2>The turorial is comprised of 2 parts: Creating and storing the files for your webpage; and uploading your website to a server. </h2>
   
<p>Start by creating a directory somewhere easy to find, (i.e. desktop), and name it something like “web-projects”. (Note: a “directory” is the coding term for folder on a computer). </p>

<p>We will use this directory to store everything that will be on your website. For now, add a profile picture to this directory</p>
<h3>It’s time to start coding. </h3>
<p>For this you will need to open VSC.    (<a href=https://code.visualstudio.com>Visual Studio Code: download</a>)</p>
<p>If you don’t already have VSC, click the link above and follow the instructions to download and install the software.</p>
<p>Open VSC and click </p> 
<ol> 
    <p><ls>New file</ls></p>
    <p><ls>Text file 'Built-in</ls></p>
    <p><ls>fill with template</ls></p>
    <p><ls>html doc</ls></p>
</ol>
<p>You should have a screen that looks something like this.</p>
<img src="v5.png" alt="VSC's html code template "/>
<p>Proceed to fill in your title name (this will be what is displayed on your Tab bar). Once this is completed enter the following text in the space below "<body></body>"</p>

<p>Note: make sure all the spelling/punctuation of the file names are exact and correspond with the files/directories created earlier.</p>

<p>Now its time to save our work and officially create our html file.</p>
<p>Click save as and navigate to the directory you made earlier. Save the file name is “index.html”.</p>

<p>Once this is done, we can test our code by clicking on the “Run and Debug icon on the left of your VSC window.</p>

<p>Note: If something doesn't work, check for typos, including punctuation</p>

<h4>Now that our files are complete, we are ready to upload to an online server. </h4>
<p>Open <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and follow the instructions to create your online profile.</p>
<p>Now that you have a profile you will need to create a repository. (Note: This is what you will type into the browser)</p>

<ol>
    <p><ls>1.	Click on the round icon on the top right of your window containing your avatar (this will be patterns if you are just logging in for the first time). </ls></p>
<img src="img4.png" alt="Github home screen"/>
    <p><ls>2. Select “Your repositories” from the dropdown list.</ls></p>
<p><ls>3.	Click on the green “New” button.</ls></p>

<p><ls>4.	Enter a repository name, then “Create Repository”.</ls></p>   
<img src="img6.png" alt="github create repository screen"/>
<p><ls>5.	Choose “upload an existing file.”</ls></p>
<p><ls>Open up your "web-projects" folder that you created earlier, then drag and drop the index.html and the profile picture into the box.</ls></p>
<p><ls>Finalise your webpage by pressing the "Commit Repository” button towards the bottom of the screen.</ls></p></ol>

<p>You can now test your personal webpage by typing your repository from earlier into the browser.</p>
